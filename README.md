# Running filmzer application
run npm install in /server, /client/admin and /client/user directories
then from the /filmzer directrory run script: npm run dev (with administrator) to run admin, client and server all together.

# Comments
1. Filmzer is using mongoDB, to customize use of DB change it in server part in the app.
2. You can run server separately with nodemon and client/admin separately with npm start in their paths
